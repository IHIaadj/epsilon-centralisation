# epsilon-centralisation

Cεntralizε is a supervision tool that offers a way to control and manage all the terminals with the Epsilon OS. Installed on the server, it gives to the administrator the possibility to manage from remote the terminals with a quite clean and simple dashboard. The administrator can then, install several packages in all the terminals at the same time, restore the terminals and get alerted of any issue.
